# custom-web-framework-mockup

## [backbonejs.org](https://backbonejs.org/)

A custom web framework mockup, built with TypeScript. It is not a production-ready framework. It is just a mockup. `backbone.js`, `vue.js`, `react.js`, and other frameworks are used as a reference. I tried to implement some of their features. I also used `json-server` to mock a REST API, `parcel` to bundle the project, `concurrently` to run multiple npm scripts at the same time.
